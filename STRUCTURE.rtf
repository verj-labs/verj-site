👋 ABOUT US
At Verj Labs, it all started with a problem we wanted to solve — and the belief that our combined expertise could build something better.
We’re a small, focused team with big ambitions. One of us is an automation specialist with deep experience in RPA, agentic workflows, and AI-powered systems. The other is a seasoned software developer — the kind of engineer who can build just about anything from scratch. Together, we decided to stop waiting for the right opportunity and start creating it.
Our mission is simple: to build digital products that are actually useful — for people, for businesses, for the world. Whether it’s an app we believe in or a tool you need built from the ground up, we bring our skills, vision, and curiosity to every line of code.
We’re proudly Canadian. And proudly different.Our working style is casual, creative, and deeply collaborative — just two friends using tech to make good things happen. If you’re looking for flashy jargon and bloated agencies, we’re probably not your fit. But if you want thoughtful builders who care about what they ship — welcome to Verj Labs.
